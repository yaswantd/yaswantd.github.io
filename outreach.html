									<h3 class="major">Outreach</h3>
									<p>I am a firm believer that science is for the betterment of the public, and as such I participate in many outreach activities to help educate the public on science and scientists. These days you can find me at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AoTBCS/"> Astronomy on Tap BCS </a>, where I run the <a href="https://twitter.com/AoT_BCS"> Twitter account </a> and the "What's Up" segments. I am a <a href="https://physics.tamu.edu/outreach/deep/"> DEEP</a> mentor, leading an undergraduate team in developing and improving demos of physics and astronomy concepts. These demos are then showcased at events around the year, primarily the <a href="https://physicsfestival.tamu.edu/"> Physics and Engineering Festival</a> in April where thousands of schoolchildren of all ages come to Texas A&amp;M to learn about physics and engineering. I also participate in the <a href="https://www.prescientist.org/"> Letters to a Pre-Scientist</a> program, where scientists are paired with various kids as pen-pals and try to inspire them to pursue careers in STEM. </p>

									<p>During my time at UT Austin, I participated in many events with the <a href="https://utexasastronomy.wixsite.com/mysite"> Astronomy Students Association</a>, where I previously acted as the President and Secretary. Some of the events: public star parties for special university/astronomical events, talks and demos for area schools, and solar observing with portable telescope at various public spaces. I also participated with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AoTATX/"> Astronomy on Tap ATX</a>, mainly operating portable telescopes for viewing during breaks and after the show. Finally, I hosted weekly star parties on the <a href="https://outreach.as.utexas.edu/public/painter.html"> Painter Hall Telescope</a>, operating the 100+ year old, 9-inch refractor for public viewing of astronomical objects.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Community Involvement</h3>
									<p>Good scientists have a strong support system. With that in mind, I am heavily involved in several groups that seek to support graduate students and other members of the Physics and Astronomy department here at Texas A&amp;M. Along with the aforementioned DEEP program, I am a leader in the <a href="https://people.physics.tamu.edu/aibhleog/supa/home.html"> Society for the Under-represented in Physics &amp; Astronomy</a> (SUPA), which aims to examine issues involving diversity and inclusion within the department, and is open to everyone regardless of identity or level within the department. I am also a mentor with the <a href="https://tamu-magic.github.io/"> MAGIC</a> program, which pairs new graduate students in astronomy with more experienced peers to ease their transition into grad school. </p>
