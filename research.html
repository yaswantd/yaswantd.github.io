									<h3 class="major">Measuring SMBH Masses</h3>
									<p>Currently I am currently working with Dr. Jonelle Walsh on the  <a href="http://www.gemini.edu/node/12610">Gemini Large and Long Program</a>, analyzing stellar kinematics in nearby galaxies to constrain the masses of the super-massive black holes (SMBH) in the center of them. The goal is to study the correlations between the masses of these SMBHs and the properties of their host galaxies, so that we may better understand how they co-evolved. The sample was selected to have galaxies with a wide range of parameters, allowing us to examine and potential bias in previous studies which focused on homogeneous samples. For more information of the SMBH-galaxy correlations, check out <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ARA%26A..51..511K/abstract"> Kormendy and Ho (2013)</a>.</p>

									<p>To find these correlations, we use a wide range of instruments in studying our sample. High resolution, low field of view spectroscopy from the adaptive optics assisted Gemini North telescope provides insight into the SMBH region of influence. To examine the galaxies on larger scales, we utilize several telescopes and instruments at the <a href="https://mcdonald.utexas.edu/">McDonald Observatory</a>. With the 10 meter Hobby-Eberly Telesope, we use the LRS2 spectroscopic instrument to study the "medium" scale properties of the galaxy, and we use the VIRUS-P and VIRUS-W spectroscopic instruments on the 2.7 meter Harlan J. Smith telescope to study the "large" scale properties. We also use Hubble imaging of our sample to examine the stellar and dust structure of our galaxies.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Previous Work</h3>
									<p>As an undergraduate, I worked on a variety of projects. For the majority of my time, I worked with the <a href="http://hetdex.org/"> HETDEX</a> collaboration, searching for Lyman-Alpha emitters at high redshift. The goal was to study how star formation in galaxies changed as a function of redshift. We also aimed to analyze the 3D structure of the universe to find evidence of baryonic acoustic oscillations, which could give us a better understanding of the role dark energy played in the evolution of the universe. I also studied gravitationally lensed LAEs to better understand the characteristics of faint, high-redshift galaxies, and to build a better understanding of the dark matter content of foreground clusters. Finally, I worked as an intern at <a href="https://www.nanohmics.com/"> Nanohmics inc.</a> to develop the technology to find exoplanets via stellar echo imaging.</p>
